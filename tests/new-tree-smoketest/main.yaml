# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# A playbook that performs a simple smoke test of Atomic Host upgrading to
# a new ostree or rebasing to a new ostree.
#
# This basically just does an upgrade/rebase, reboot, rollback, and reboot on an
# Atomic Host.
#
# In order to support the ability to test the 'rebase' scenario, certain tags
# had to be added to some tasks, so that we could exclude some tasks.
#
# For example, in the case of the 'rebase' option, it is unlikely that we want
# to subscribe using 'subscription-manager' or run the 'rpm-ostree upgrade'
# command.  One would run this test using:
#
# '--skip-tags subscription_manager,rpm_ostree_upgrade'
#
# ...when testing the 'rebase' option.
#
# Additionally, when testing the 'upgrade' option, the test should be run
# with '--skip-tags rpm_ostree_rebase'
#
# If the 'jenkins' tag is not skipped, it also performs some data gathering
# operations which will generate output files on the host that can be
# retrieved.
#
# This playbook expects the following variables defined:
#  - datadir
#  - initial_rpms
#  - upgraded_rpms
#
# Additional variables may be required by the included task files.
#
# Most variables are defined in the included file 'vars/smoketest_vars.yaml'
