# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# A playbook that performs a simple smoke test of Atomic Host upgrading to
# a new ostree.
#
# This basically just does an upgrade, reboot, rollback, and reboot on an
# Atomic Host.
#
# If the 'jenkins' tag is not skipped, it also performs some data gathering
# operations which will generate output files on the host that can be
# retrieved.
#
# This playbook expects the following variables defined:
#  - datadir
#  - initial_rpms
#  - upgraded_rpms
#  - output_file
#  - version_file
#
# Additional variables may be required by the included task files.
#
# See `tests/new-tree-smoketest/group_vars/all` for example values
