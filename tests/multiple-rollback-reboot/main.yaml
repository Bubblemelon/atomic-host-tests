# This playibook tests the ability to perform multiple rollbacks in
# succession. After eact rollback, the system is rebooted and the output
# of 'rpm-ostree status' is examined to determine if the proper deployment
# was booted.
#
# Because the playbook attempts to register the system with
# 'subscription-manager' if it is a RHEL system, it expects to have the
# variables in 'vars/subscription.yaml' defined.
