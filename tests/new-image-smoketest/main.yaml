# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# This playbook performs a simple smoketest of a new Atomic Host cloud image.
#
# The test assumes that new ostree content and cloud image have been released
# simultaneously.  Therefore, it tests if an upgrade is available (it shouldn't
# be) and if a rollback is possilbe (also should not be).
#
# If the 'jenkins' tag is not skipped, it also performs some data gathering
# operations which will generate output files on the host that can be
# retrieved.
#
# This playbook expects the following variables defined:
#  - datadir
#  - initial_rpms
#  - upgraded_rpms
#
# Most variables are defined in the included file 'vars/smoketest_vars.yaml'
#
# See `tests/new-tree-smoketest/group_vars/all` for example values
