# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# This playbook tests the ability to interrupt a upgrade operation without
# any negative impact to the system.
#
# The interrupt ability is tested via the included bash script
# ('atomic_upgrade_interrupt.sh').  Please see the script for implementation
# details.
#
# By default, the script tries to interrupt the upgrade operation once, but
# any number of interrupts can be attempted by supplying a different value
# to the 'iterations' variable.
#
# The playbook requires the following variable set:
#   - datadir
#
# See the 'vars/smoketest_vars.yaml' for example values.
#
# Because the playbook attempts to register the system with
# 'subscription-manager' if it is a RHEL system, it expects to have the
# variables in 'vars/subscription.yaml' defined.
