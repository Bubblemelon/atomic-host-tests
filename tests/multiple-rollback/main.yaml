# This playibook tests the ability to perform multiple rollbacks in
# succession.  This just tests the ability to toggle the deployment without
# actually rebooting into each deployment.  After each rollback, the output
# of 'rpm-ostree status' is inspected to verify that the proper deployment
# has been selected for boot.
#
# Because the playbook attempts to register the system with
# 'subscription-manager' if it is a RHEL system, it expects to have the
# variables in 'vars/subscription.yaml' defined.
