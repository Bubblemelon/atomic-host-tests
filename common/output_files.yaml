# Tasks to template out some text files on the host

# Expects the following variables to be configured:
#   - datadir
#   - output_file
#   - version_file
#
# NOTE: The templates require a number of variables to also be configured.
#       Typically these tasks would be run after 'common/collect_data.yaml'
#       and 'common/rpm_diffs.yaml'.  Please see the templates for the full
#       set of variables that are necessary.
